# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Overview

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is designed to act as an intermediary between an AI model and external systems or data sources. It provides a structured way for an AI to perform actions and retrieve information that it cannot directly access or execute.

## How MCP Server Integration Works

### Core Communication (stdio)
- The primary method of communication between an AI agent (or any client application) and an MCP server is through **standard input/output (stdio)**.
- The AI agent runs the MCP server as a **child process**.

### Requests
- The AI agent sends **JSON-formatted requests** to the MCP server via its `stdin`.
- These requests specify:
    - Which **tool** to call (e.g., `calculate`, `filesystem`), or
    - Which **resource** to read (e.g., `resource://config/current`)
    - Along with any necessary **arguments or parameters**.

### Responses
- The MCP server processes the request and sends back a **JSON-formatted response** via its `stdout`.
- This response contains either:
    - The **result of the tool execution**, or
    - The **content of the requested resource**.

## Tool Execution
When the AI needs to perform an action, it sends a `CallToolRequest` to the MCP server.

1. The server receives the request.
2. Identifies the specified tool.
3. Validates the arguments.
4. Executes the tool's **handler function** (e.g., perform a calculation, write a file).
5. Returns the result.

The AI then interprets this result and uses it to inform its next steps or generate a response to the user.

---

## Resource Access
When the AI needs to retrieve information, it sends a `ReadResourceRequest` to the MCP server.

1. The server receives the request.
2. Identifies the specified **resource URI**.
3. Retrieves the relevant data (e.g., configuration, documentation, log entries).
4. Returns the result.

The AI can then use this information to:
- Answer questions
- Make decisions
- Understand its operational environment

## AI’s Role

The AI model is responsible for:

- **Understanding Context**: Determining when an external action or information retrieval is needed.
- **Tool/Resource Selection**: Choosing the right tool/resource from the server’s capabilities.
- **Parameter Generation**: Formulating the correct arguments for the selected tool or resource.
- **Response Interpretation**: Parsing the JSON response and integrating it into reasoning.

## Secondary Integration Points (HTTP)

While `stdio` is used for core tool/resource interaction, an MCP server may also expose **HTTP endpoints** for:

- **Health Checks**
    - Example: `http://localhost:3001/health`
    - Used by monitoring systems to verify the server is running.

- **Metrics**
    - Example: `http://localhost:3001/metrics`
    - Provides operational metrics such as request counts and response times.

## Summary

The MCP server **extends the AI's capabilities** by providing a secure, structured, and auditable interface to:
- Interact with the real world
- Access specialized data
- Perform external actions
